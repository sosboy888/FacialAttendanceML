# FacialAttendanceCNN
Uses a convolutional neural network instead of cascades to identify faces in the image, with cropping images being the method of image augmentation

## Classification or Recognition
All the faces are divided into n labels and the label number is their unique identification as well.

## Performance
I have managed to achieve up to 200FPS(latency and frames collectively) and I think it can do even better on the latest CUDA GPUS(I have a GTX 1060).
